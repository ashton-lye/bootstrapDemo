# bootstrapDemo

This was originally created for an assignment in the Internet and Web Development paper in my second year of study. A very basic HTML-only site containing the information on this project's pages was originally used by students. The assignment brief was to make a more professional and organised, updated version of the site using CSS and the Bootstrap library.
